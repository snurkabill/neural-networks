Just a note, it's my hobby! :) 

There are various types of NN: MLP, RBM, DBN, DBM. 

everything is trained with gradient descent, there is also greedy layer-wised unsupervised pretraining algorithm :)

Everything is setted up with heuristic. Each network has it's own manager, you just need to provide neural network and database.

There is also supervised and unsupervised benchmarking of networks, so there is easy comparation of which network is good for what. 

I've created fast database for providing generic data-vectors concurrently for neural networks :)
